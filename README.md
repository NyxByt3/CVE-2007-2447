The error you're encountering indicates that the Python script is trying to import a module named `smb`, but it is not installed on your system. The smb module is part of the pysmb library, which allows you to interact with SMB/CIFS servers.

To resolve this issue, you need to install the `pysmb` library. You can do this using `pip`. Here's how:

1. Install pysmb:

```
pip install pysmb
```

2. Verify the installation: After installing, you can verify that the pysmb module is installed by running:
```
python -c "import smb; print('pysmb is installed')"
```
